            </p>
            <p>Street art is visual art created in public locations, usually unsanctioned artwork executed outside of the context of traditional art venues. Artists who choose the streets as their gallery are often doing so from a preference to communicate directly with the public at large, free from perceived confines of the formal art world. Street artists sometimes present socially relevant content infused with esthetic value, to attract attention to a cause or as a form of "art provocation".</p>
